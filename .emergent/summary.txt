The previous AI engineer successfully migrated an Angular application to React, implementing responsive design and setting up a full-stack architecture. Key decisions included building a new Node.js/Express backend with PostgreSQL, integrating JWT authentication, and providing detailed deployment documentation. The process involved extensive component refactoring, CSS adjustments for responsiveness, and diligent troubleshooting of integration issues, particularly with login functionality. The engineer demonstrated a methodical approach, addressing user feedback iteratively and adapting the solution based on environmental constraints and user needs, such as creating a new backend when the provided one was unusable. The work progressed from front-end migration to backend setup and finally to database integration and login validation, culminating in a seemingly functional application ready for deployment.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested to migrate an existing Angular application to React, ensuring all original functionality and structure were preserved. Following the migration, the user explicitly asked for the application to be made fully responsive, as its layout was out of place across different screen sizes. A subsequent critical request involved providing working login credentials, which led to the AI engineer implementing a temporary login system and later integrating a real backend. The user then asked to connect the application to a specified GitHub backend. When this backend proved problematic, the requirement shifted to creating a new, functional Node.js/Express backend from scratch. Finally, the user mandated migrating the backend's data persistence to PostgreSQL, including database creation, user setup, credential provision, and comprehensive deployment documentation for local setup and server deployment. The latest request is to resolve login issues after the PostgreSQL migration.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, React Context API, Axios, CSS (for responsive design).
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express, PostgreSQL,  (PostgreSQL client),  (password hashing),  (JWT for authentication).
- **Infrastructure:** Supervisor (process management), Kubernetes Ingress (routing),  files (configuration), Yarn (package management).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application now features a full-stack architecture.


- ****: This file is critical as the main entry point for the Node.js Express backend. It now initializes the PostgreSQL connection, sets up middleware (CORS, JSON parsing), and mounts various route modules (auth, users, esp32). It was entirely rewritten from the initial FastAPI concept to Node.js/Express.
- ****: A newly created file that handles the PostgreSQL database connection using the  module. It defines a client pool and a function to initialize the database by creating tables (, ) and inserting default data if they don't exist. This centralized the DB connection logic.
- ****: This new file defines the  and  endpoints. It handles user authentication, password hashing with bcrypt, JWT token generation, and interaction with the PostgreSQL  table.
- ****: The central React component managing application routing with . It now wraps the entire application within  to make authentication state globally available. It was completely rewritten during the Angular to React migration.
- ****: This file provides a React Context for managing global authentication state. It includes , , and  functions that interact with the backend API, and manages the JWT token in local storage. It was created as part of the React migration and refined for backend integration.
- ** and **: These files define the login user interface and its logic. The  now handles authentication against the actual backend, manages loading states, and crucially, has been modified to include a TESTING PANEL with Load Admin, Load Demo, and ðŸš€ LOGIN DIRECTO buttons to facilitate direct login for debugging.  was updated for responsive design and to style the new testing panel.
- ** & **: These CSS files define global styles and crucial responsive design rules. They were extensively modified to address the user's request for responsive design, correcting layout issues like conflicting  styles and ensuring elements are properly centered and proportioned across various screen sizes.

- While the project was declared complete by the AI, a minor issue with the ESP32 data display formatting was noted in a testing summary (Chat 300) but not explicitly addressed as a primary task.
- Persistent ESLint warnings in various React components were observed throughout the development (e.g., Chat 110, 112, 114, 128, etc.), but the AI engineer typically proceeded stating the file was saved correctly. These are code quality issues rather than functional bugs.

<current_work>
The current work is focused on resolving a persistent login issue reported by the user. Despite the backend functioning correctly (verified via cURL and database checks showing user existence) and the frontend seemingly making correct API calls, the user is unable to log in and access other screens, stating credenciales salen incorrectas (credentials are incorrect).

To troubleshoot this, the AI engineer has implemented a TESTING PANEL within the  file. This panel includes:
1.  **Load Admin button**: Automatically pre-fills the login form with  and .
2.  **Load Demo button**: Automatically pre-fills with  and .
3.  **ðŸš€ LOGIN DIRECTO button**: This is the most recent addition. It bypasses the form entirely and directly attempts to log in the user, navigating them to the dashboard if successful. This is intended to rule out any issues related to manual input or form submission.

The CSS () has also been updated to style this new testing panel and remove the previously added demo credentials display, as real authentication is now in place. The AI engineer has provided explicit instructions on how to use these buttons to log in.

Verify that clicking the ðŸš€ LOGIN DIRECTO button on the login page successfully navigates the user to the dashboard.
